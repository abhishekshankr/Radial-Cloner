<p>
Radial Cloner is a figma plugin that can create clones of a selected object around a circle. The number of copies and circle width along with alignment of the objects can be specified in the plugin.

<h2>
How to use
</h2>
<p>
Select an object and run the plugin. The clone count option lets you change the number of copies to be created. The circle width lets you choose the width of the circle onto which the objects will be cloned.
<b> NOTE: The objects will be cloned with their center on the circle. The circle width value does not equate to the width and height of the final cloned output. </b>
The alignment option lets you either align the clones tangentially to the circle or maintain the initial orientation for all clones. Click on the create clones to create a new radial group.
